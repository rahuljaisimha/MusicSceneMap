Setlist.fm Crawl Script

Fetches setlist data for artists in the Supabase database and stores:
- Venues (id, name, city, country)
- played_at relationships (artist → venue, with count)
- toured_with relationships (artists who shared a venue+date)

Designed to run daily, respecting the 1,440 requests/day limit.
Picks up where it left off — tracks which artists have been crawled.

Usage:
    pip install psycopg2-binary requests
    export SUPABASE_DB_URL='postgresql://...'
    export SETLISTFM_API_KEY='your-key'
    python3 server/crawl_setlistfm.py [--limit 100] [--pages 3]

Options:
    --limit N     Max artists to crawl this run (default: 100)
    --pages N     Max pages per artist (default: 3, each page = 20 setlists)
