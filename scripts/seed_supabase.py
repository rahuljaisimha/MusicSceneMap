Seed Supabase PostgreSQL with the music graph.

Same inputs as process_mb_dump.py (load_graph_inputs): the curated seed artists
at 6 hops plus every artist with a concert in concert-database at CONCERTDB_HOPS
(default 6), over band relationships. Unlike the browser graph it is never cut
down to fit a download size: Postgres answers for the artists graph.db.gz leaves out.

Writes:
  artists        — every reachable artist (mbid, name, type, disambiguation, area,
                   genre_ids: ids into `genres`, most voted first; see pick_genres)
  genres         — every genre an artist uses (id, name), replaced on each run
  relationships  — band relationships between them (member_of, former_member_of,
                   support_musician), and collaborations from each reachable
                   artist to the artists whose records they produced or performed
                   on (produced_for, collaborated_with; `count` = song credits)

No album table and no per-album credit rows (migration 005 removes the old ones).

Usage:
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    export SUPABASE_DB_URL='postgresql://...'
    python3 scripts/seed_supabase.py            # after process_mb_dump.py has extracted the dump
    python3 scripts/seed_supabase.py --dry-run  # count the rows, write nothing (no SUPABASE_DB_URL needed)
