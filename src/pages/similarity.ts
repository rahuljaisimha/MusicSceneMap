/**
 * Pure logic for scoring how similar a target artist is to a list of artists,
 * based on the structure of the music graph.
 *
 * This is deliberately decoupled from React and from the sql.js DB: it operates
 * over a small `GraphAccess` interface so it can be unit-tested with an in-memory
 * fake. The SimilarityPage wires the real graphDb helpers into this interface.
 *
 * The graph is treated as a weighted graph: each relationship has a weight
 * (REL_WEIGHTS, 0..1; a band membership is 1.0, producing someone's records
 * 0.3), stored as an edge length −ln(weight) (REL_DISTANCES), so strong ties are
 * short. The first FREE_HOPS (2) hops are free; every hop after that also adds
 * HOP_DISTANCE (−ln 0.9), so a chain of members doesn't stay at 100 forever.
 * Two artists are as close as the shortest path between them:
 *
 *   pair score = 100 × e^(−path length)
 *              = 100 × (weights along the path, multiplied) × 0.9^(hops − 2, if more than 2)
 *
 * Examples: Ty Segall — member — Fuzz = 100; bandmates Mikal Cronin — member —
 * Ty Segall Band — member — Ty Segall = 100; Fuzz — Ty Segall — opened for
 * Osees (3 shows) ← opened for — Iguana Death Cult = 1.0 × 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.9 = 65.
 *
 * One search (Dijkstra from the compared artist) finds the strongest path to
 * every liked artist. The weights are placeholders, intended to be tuned.
