# Supabase Edge Functions

## venue-search

On-demand venue lookup for an artist in a city. Resolves artists, fetches from Setlist.fm, caches results, detects touring partners.

### Endpoint

```
GET https://lwqkjtzqjgacgvfjiyxg.supabase.co/functions/v1/venue-search
```

### Parameters

| Param | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `city` | Yes | City name (e.g. "Los Angeles") |
| `artist` | One of these | Artist name (resolved against DB, then MusicBrainz) |
| `artistMbid` | One of these | MusicBrainz ID directly (avoids name ambiguity) |

### Example

```
/venue-search?artist=Ty+Segall&city=Los+Angeles
/venue-search?artistMbid=07a17571-81fc-4cf8-a634-98f0d926d313&city=Austin
```

### Response

```json
{
  "source": "cache" | "api",
  "stale": false,
  "artist": "mbid",
  "city": "Los Angeles",
  "venues": [
    { "venue": "Zebulon", "city": "Los Angeles", "country": "United States", "showCount": 12 },
    { "venue": "Lodge Room", "city": "Los Angeles", "country": "United States", "showCount": 5 }
  ]
}
```

### How it works

1. **Resolve artist**: check our DB by name → if not found, try MusicBrainz API → if found, add to our DB + log miss
2. **Check cache**: look in `crawl_log` for this artist+city. If <14 days old, return cached data.
3. **If stale or miss**: call Setlist.fm API with `cityName` filter → store venues + `played_at` relationships
4. **Detect touring partners**: check venue setlists for other artists on the same date → store `toured_with` relationships
5. **Update crawl_log** timestamp

### Artist resolution fallback

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Found in our `artists` table | Use directly |
| Not in DB, MusicBrainz resolves it | Add to `artists` table, log to `search_misses` (source: `venue-search-missing-artist`) |
| Not found anywhere (likely mistype) | Log to `search_misses` (source: `venue-search-not-found`), return 404 |

## report-miss

Lightweight endpoint for the frontend to report artists missing from the browser SQLite.

### Endpoint

```
POST https://lwqkjtzqjgacgvfjiyxg.supabase.co/functions/v1/report-miss
```

### Body

```json
{ "query": "Frankie and the Witch Fingers", "source": "sqlite-missing" }
```

### Sources

| source | Meaning | Action needed |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite-missing` | Artist exists in Supabase but not in browser SQLite | Regenerate SQLite |
| `venue-search-missing-artist` | Not in DB, resolved via MusicBrainz, added to Supabase | Will be in SQLite on next regen |
| `venue-search-not-found` | Not found anywhere (mistype) | No action |

### Querying misses

```sql
SELECT query, source, COUNT(*) as times
FROM search_misses
WHERE source IN ('sqlite-missing', 'venue-search-missing-artist')
GROUP BY query, source
ORDER BY times DESC;
```

---

## graph-neighbors

Tier-2 graph lookup for the client's tiered `GraphAccess`: resolves an artist and its 1-hop neighbors from the `relationships` table. Used as a fallback when an artist isn't in the browser's core SQLite graph (Tier 1). If Postgres also misses, the client falls back to MusicBrainz (Tier 3).

### Endpoint

```
GET https://lwqkjtzqjgacgvfjiyxg.supabase.co/functions/v1/graph-neighbors
```

### Parameters

| Param | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mbid` | One of these | Artist MBID (preferred, unambiguous) |
| `name` | One of these | Artist name (case-insensitive, exact match preferred) |
| `log` | No | `0` skips logging a miss. The app sends it for lookups made while the browser graph is still downloading. |

### Response

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "artist": { "id": "<mbid>", "name": "The Sleeves", "type": "group" },
  "neighbors": [
    { "node": { "id": "<mbid>", "name": "Someone", "type": "person" }, "relType": "member_of", "outgoing": false }
  ]
}
```

Misses are logged to `search_misses` with source `graph-neighbors-not-found`, unless `log=0` is passed.

Besides the Tier-2 fallback, the app calls this for every artist lookup while the ~49MB browser graph is still downloading (see `src/db/graphSource.ts`), always with `log=0`.

### Search mode (artist dropdowns)

```
GET https://lwqkjtzqjgacgvfjiyxg.supabase.co/functions/v1/graph-neighbors?q=fuzz&limit=8
```

| Param | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | Yes | Typed text, at least 2 characters (shorter returns no artists) |
| `limit` | No | Max results, default 8, max 25 |

```json
{ "artists": [
  { "id": "<mbid>", "name": "Fuzz", "type": "group", "disambiguation": "US garage rock band", "area": "San Francisco" }
] }
```

Ranked: exact name, names starting with `q`, names with a word starting with `q`, other substring matches; shorter names first. No neighbors, and never writes to `search_misses`. `area` is null until migration 004 has run and `seed_supabase.py` has been re-run. The app asks MusicBrainz only when this returns nothing or fails (see `src/db/artistSuggest.ts`).

Relationship types returned: `member_of`, `former_member_of`, `support_musician`, `collaborated_with` and `produced_for` (from the credited artist to the record's artist; `outgoing` says which end the looked-up artist is), and `opened_for` once Postgres has it.

> Postgres is seeded (`seed_supabase.py`) with every artist within reach of the curated seeds and of concert-database's artists, never cut down for size; the browser graph is the same set, cut down to fit its 74 MB download limit when it has to be. So Postgres covers the artists the browser graph leaves out.

## Migrations

Run in the Supabase SQL Editor (Dashboard → SQL Editor):

1. `migrations/001_schema.sql` — artists, albums, venues, relationships tables
2. `migrations/002_crawl_log.sql` — crawl freshness tracking
3. `migrations/003_search_misses.sql` — logging unknown artist queries
4. `migrations/004_artist_search.sql` — trigram index for `graph-neighbors` search mode, `artists.area` (re-run `seed_supabase.py` after it to fill `area`)
5. `migrations/005_collaborations.sql` — removes the album table and the per-album credit rows (seed_supabase.py now writes `collaborated_with` / `produced_for` artist → artist rows with the song-credit count), and two redundant indexes. Then run `VACUUM FULL relationships;` on its own to give the space back, re-run `seed_supabase.py`, and redeploy `graph-neighbors`.
6. `migrations/006_genres.sql` — `genres` table and `artists.genre_ids` (MusicBrainz genres with 2+ votes, top 3 plus ties). Then re-run `seed_supabase.py` to fill them.
7. `migrations/007_search_misses_reader.sql` — read-only role `concertdb_misses` (can only read `search_misses`) for concert-database's nightly `misses` step. Then give it a login outside git: `ALTER ROLE concertdb_misses LOGIN PASSWORD '…'`, and set `MSM_MISSES_DB_URL` in concert-database's `.env`.
