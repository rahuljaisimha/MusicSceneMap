-- Migration 007: a read-only login for concert-database's `misses` step
--
-- concert-database (github.com/rahuljaisimha/concert-database, concertdb/misses.py)
-- reads new rows of search_misses every night and crawls those artists' concerts,
-- so they join the graph at the next rebuild. It connects as this role, which can
-- read search_misses and nothing else (no other table, no writes).
--
-- The role is created without a login. Give it one outside git (the password is
-- a secret), in the SQL editor:
--   ALTER ROLE concertdb_misses LOGIN PASSWORD '<a long random password>';
-- and set in concert-database's .env (Supavisor pooler: user is <role>.<project ref>):
--   MSM_MISSES_DB_URL=postgresql://concertdb_misses.<project ref>:<password>@<pooler host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
